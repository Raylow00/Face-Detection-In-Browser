# Face-Detection-In-Browser
A simple web app to demonstrate how to detect faces of photos uploaded to websites using a simple face detection API.
Credits go to @justadudewhohacks who created the API.

What I Learnt:
- how to integrate the API into my own web app
- how to use Javascript to connect to Firebase
